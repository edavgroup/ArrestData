## Research topic



## Data availability
We will explore the arrest record data in New York City during the current year. We extract the data from New York OpenData, which is a free public data source published by New York City agencies and other organizations. The data we will use is collected by the New York Police Department(NYPD), including information about the type of crime, the location, the demographics of perpetrators, and so on. The Office of Management Analysis and Planning extracts and reviews the data every quarter. The data is last updated on Oct 19, 2022. The dataset contains 141,000 observations with 19 columns in a structured form. Each row represents an arrest effected in New York City by NYPD. We can export the dataset in CSV format for offline use from New York OpenData. Then we can import and manipulate the CSV formatted data in R from the local path.
