We start analysis the crime pattern by picturing the criminals.

With the arrest records, we plot the basic information (age, gender and race) for all arrestees. Then we could depicting the portraits for those criminal group.


```{r}
data =  read.socrata("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc")
data <- data %>%
  drop_na(pd_desc, ky_cd,pd_cd)

figure1 <- ggplot(data, aes(x=age_group))+ 
  geom_histogram(stat="count",position="identity", alpha=0.5)+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(caption="Figure.1 Age Distribution of the Criminals", 
       x="age", y="count")+ 
  theme_minimal()

figure2 <- ggplot(data, aes(x=perp_sex))+ 
  geom_histogram(stat="count",position="identity", alpha=0.5)+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(caption="Figure.2 Sex Distribution of the Criminals", 
       x="sex", y="count")+ 
  theme_minimal()

ggarrange(figure1, figure2, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)
```


```{r}
figure3 <- ggplot(data, aes(x=perp_race))+ 
  geom_histogram(stat="count",position="identity", alpha=0.5)+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(caption="Figure.3 Race Distribution of the Criminals", 
       x="race", y="count")+ 
  theme_minimal()

figure3
```

From the above 3 figures, we can observe the following characteristics of the captured criminalsï¼š
1. Men dominate.
2. The age group shows an approximate natural distribution pattern, mainly concentrated in 25-44 years old.
3. Black and White Hispanic mainly.
Such data can help police better understand the psychology of criminal groups.
