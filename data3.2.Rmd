```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(RSocrata)

```{r}
data =  read.socrata("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc")
```

```{r}
glimpse(data)
```

```{r}
head(data)
```

```{r}
data = data %>% select(-c(geocoded_column))
```

We drop the column called 'geocoded_column', since this column is a combination of longitude coordinate as x coordinate and latitude coordinate as y coordinate.

```{r}
table(data %>% select(c(age_group)))
```

We notice that the age groups are not classified evenly. However, the number of arrests with age group of '18-24' is extremely large comparing to other age groups. It is worth noticing and explicitly indicating that in plots. Therefore, we keep the categories of age unchanged.
