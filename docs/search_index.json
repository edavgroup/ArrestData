According to NYPD statistics, the number of crimes in New York City increased from 8,906 in July 2021 to 11,619 in July 2022, an increase of 30.5 percent. Almost all types of crime increased last month. The number of high-profile subway crimes also continues to rise, with Manhattan topping the list among the five boroughs. Meanwhile, a surge in shootings in Brooklyn, Southern Queens and Staten Island also increased the number of shootings citywide from 157 in July last year to 178 this year, a 13.4 percent increase. On enforcement, NYPD officers in October 2022 made 4,367 arrests for complaints of major felony crimes, a 16.5% increase over the 3,749 arrests for major felonies in the same month last year. Arrests for major felonies are up 25.8% (39,742 v. 31,582) so far in calendar 2022, compared with the first 10 months of 2021. “Keeping New Yorkers safe is our mission – and the NYPD’s commitment to the public will never waver,” said Police Commissioner Keechant L. Sewell. “Our work to suppress violence, to maintain order on our streets and in our subway stations is intelligence-driven, flexible, and focused on prevention. Our officers are elevating their work every day – particularly in the subway system where the public is seeing our visible presence, extensive coverage in trains and platforms, and more engagement with riders and those who work in the system.” With the historical analysis of the arrest records in NYC, our article considers the ongoing debate over crime rates in different districts, portrait of a crime figures, as the next potential crisis for the NYPD. The paper concludes with a discussion of methods that could assist the police in deploying police forces, faster implementation of arrest operations, and improve urban security. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic In this project, we will explore the arrests records in NYC during the current year. It is well known that New York has a high crime rate in the country. How Newyork’s police deal with it and what we can do to improve the efficiency of polices’ work? Here, we will analyze the portraits of Perpetrators arrested in New York State, including their age and gender. Also, we will gathering the information about the arrest actions like the frequency of arrests by region. All these information can provide effective data, help the police to locate suspects more quickly when a crime is committed, and assist the police to understand the criminal psychology of the offender. At the same time, it can also assist the police in deploying police forces, faster implementation of arrest operations, and improve urban security. 2.2 Data availability We will mainly explore the arrest record data in New York City during the current year. We extract the data from New York OpenData (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc), which is a free public data source published by New York City agencies and other organizations. The data we will use is collected by the New York Police Department(NYPD), including information about the type of crime, the location, the demographics of perpetrators, and so on. The Office of Management Analysis and Planning extracts and reviews the data every quarter. The data is last updated on Oct 19, 2022. The dataset is categorized as public safety and contains 141,000 observations with 19 columns in a structured form. Each row represents an arrest effected in New York City by NYPD. The column shows the basic information about the arrest, including the time, location, and level of offense. At the same time, the dataset also contains descriptions of perpetrators, such as gender, age, race, etc. Based on these data, we can well accomplish our research goals. We can export the datasets in CSV format for offline use from New York OpenData. Then we can import and manipulate the CSV formatted data in R from the local path. 2.2.0.1 Meanwhile, we will also compare the current year’s arrest information with the past to get the changes in the crime rate in New York City in recent years. We obtain the historic data from the same platform New York OpenData (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u). This dataset has the same format as year-to-date data, making it easy to compare with each other. The historic dataset is last updated on June 9, 2022. We can export these two datasets in CSV format for offline use from New York OpenData. Then we can import and manipulate the CSV formatted data in R from the local path. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources After deciding the topic of the project, all of our team members searched data together to find the most suitable one. We have found that, to identify the crime types, patterns and so on, we need to get some historical crime data. Also, the data released by government or other official department would be more reliable. Here we extract the arrest records data from New York OpenData (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc), which is a free public data source published by New York City agencies and other organizations. The data we will use is collected by the New York Police Department(NYPD), including information about the type of crime, the location, the demographics of perpetrators, and so on. The Office of Management Analysis and Planning extracts and reviews the data every quarter. The data is last updated on Oct 19, 2022. The dataset is categorized as public safety and contains 141,000 observations with 19 columns in a structured form. Each row represents an arrest effected in New York City by NYPD. The column shows the basic information about the arrest, including the time, location, and level of offense. At the same time, the dataset also contains descriptions of perpetrators, such as gender, age, race, etc. Based on these data, we can well accomplish our research goals. To fully explored the arrest pattern, a single dataset is not reliable. Therefore, we collected historic data for arrests records from the same platform, New York OpenData, (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u). This dataset has the same format as year-to-date data, making it easy to compare with each other. However, we found that this historic dataset was only updated on June 9, 2022 lastly, which has been covered by our primal dataset. Therefore, instead of using both datasets, we use only the primal one in our projects. We can export the dataset in CSV format for offline use from New York OpenData. Then we can import and manipulate the CSV formatted data in R from the local path. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation ## arrest_key arrest_date pd_cd pd_desc ky_cd ## 1 238492853 2022-01-01 258 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF 4TH, GRAFFIT 351 ## 2 238496466 2022-01-01 244 BURGLARY,UNCLASSIFIED,UNKNOWN 107 ## 3 238498340 2022-01-01 792 CRIMINAL POSSESSION WEAPON 118 ## 4 238513835 2022-01-01 109 ASSAULT 2,1,UNCLASSIFIED 106 ## 5 238513876 2022-01-01 112 MENACING 1ST DEGREE (VICT NOT 126 ## 6 238513883 2022-01-01 339 LARCENY,PETIT FROM OPEN AREAS, 341 ## ofns_desc law_code law_cat_cd arrest_boro ## 1 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF &amp; RELATED OF PL 1456002 M K ## 2 BURGLARY PL 1402000 F M ## 3 DANGEROUS WEAPONS PL 265031B F Q ## 4 FELONY ASSAULT PL 1200501 F B ## 5 MISCELLANEOUS PENAL LAW PL 1201800 F K ## 6 PETIT LARCENY PL 1552500 M K ## arrest_precinct jurisdiction_code age_group perp_sex perp_race ## 1 72 1 18-24 M WHITE ## 2 23 0 25-44 F WHITE ## 3 114 0 18-24 M BLACK ## 4 47 2 25-44 M BLACK ## 5 71 97 25-44 M BLACK HISPANIC ## 6 60 0 25-44 M BLACK ## x_coord_cd y_coord_cd latitude longitude ## 1 984074 178984 40.65795 -74.00063 ## 2 997744 228061 40.79264 -73.95127 ## 3 1010642 218253 40.76569 -73.90472 ## 4 1026480 262584 40.88731 -73.84727 ## 5 1000099 178227 40.65586 -73.94288 ## 6 985372 147958 40.57279 -73.99596 ## geocoded_column ## 1 POINT (-74.000634 40.657949) ## 2 POINT (-73.951265 40.792642) ## 3 POINT (-73.904725 40.765692) ## 4 POINT (-73.8472717577564 40.8873136344706) ## 5 POINT (-73.942878 40.655857) ## 6 POINT (-73.99596126 40.57278637) 3.3 Missing value analysis 3.3.1 Why analyse missing value? In this section, we want to know the distribution of missing values in the original dataset. Through missing pattern analysis, we are able to get an overview of the missing logic and determine how to deal with these missing values. Whether to delete them directly or to approach them based on other non-missing values? 3.3.2 Missing pattern We start by analysis the missing pattern of the whole dataset. The left-bottom bar chart shows the total number of missing values in each column. The right chart shows the intersection pattern of the missing value. From the chart above, we can find that among 19 column in original data set, only 3 columns (pd_cd, pd_desc, ky_cd) has missing value. - pd_cd: Three digit arrest internal classification code. - pd_desc: The description of internal classification code - ky_cd: Three digit internal classification code (more general category than PD code) Notice the relation among pd_cd, pd_desc and ky_cd, it is easy to understand the consistency of missing value. Since the Keycode is a more general category, if the Key code of an arrest event is unknown, the PD code also remains unknown. Similarly, if the PD code is unkown, we cannot describe it. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results", " Chapter 4 Results We start analysis the crime pattern by picturing the criminals. With the arrest records, we plot the basic information (age, gender and race) for all arrestees. Then we could depicting the portraits for those criminal group. Race. From the above 3 figures, we can observe the following characteristics of the captured criminals： 1. Men dominate. 2. The age group shows an approximate natural distribution pattern, mainly concentrated in 25-44 years old. 3. Black and White Hispanic mainly. Such data can help police better understand the psychology of criminal groups.
