[["index.html", "Exploration of Arrest Records in NYC Chapter 1 Introduction", " Exploration of Arrest Records in NYC Lingjun Zhang, Yijia He, Junyuan Huang 2022-12-15 Chapter 1 Introduction The crime rate in New York has been the topics for many years. According to NYPD statistics, the number of crimes in New York City increased from 8,906 in July 2021 to 11,619 in July 2022, an increase of 30.5 percent. Almost all types of crime increased last month. The number of high-profile subway crimes also continues to rise, with Manhattan topping the list among the five boroughs. Meanwhile, a surge in shootings in Brooklyn, Southern Queens and Staten Island also increased the number of shootings citywide from 157 in July last year to 178 this year, a 13.4 percent increase. On enforcement, NYPD officers in October 2022 made 4,367 arrests for complaints of major felony crimes, a 16.5% increase over the 3,749 arrests for major felonies in the same month last year. Arrests for major felonies are up 25.8% (39,742 v. 31,582) so far in calendar 2022, compared with the first 10 months of 2021. “Keeping New Yorkers safe is our mission – and the NYPD’s commitment to the public will never waver,” said Police Commissioner Keechant L. Sewell. “Our work to suppress violence, to maintain order on our streets and in our subway stations is intelligence-driven, flexible, and focused on prevention. Our officers are elevating their work every day – particularly in the subway system where the public is seeing our visible presence, extensive coverage in trains and platforms, and more engagement with riders and those who work in the system.” With the historical analysis of the arrest records in NYC, our article considers the ongoing debate over crime rates in different districts, portrait of a crime figures, as the next potential crisis for the NYPD. The paper concludes with a discussion of methods that could assist the police in deploying police forces, faster implementation of arrest operations, and improve urban security. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic In this project, we will explore the arrests records in NYC during the current year. It is well known that New York has a high crime rate in the country. How Newyork’s police deal with it and what we can do to improve the efficiency of polices’ work? Here, we will analyze the portraits of Perpetrators arrested in New York State, including their age and gender. Also, we will gathering the information about the arrest actions like the frequency of arrests by region. All these information can provide effective data, help the police to locate suspects more quickly when a crime is committed, and assist the police to understand the criminal psychology of the offender. At the same time, it can also assist the police in deploying police forces, faster implementation of arrest operations, and improve urban security. 2.2 Data availability We will mainly explore the arrest record data in New York City during the current year. We extract the data from New York OpenData (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc), which is a free public data source published by New York City agencies and other organizations. The data we will use is collected by the New York Police Department(NYPD), including information about the type of crime, the location, the demographics of perpetrators, and so on. The Office of Management Analysis and Planning extracts and reviews the data every quarter. The data is last updated on Oct 19, 2022. The dataset is categorized as public safety and contains 141,000 observations with 19 columns in a structured form. Each row represents an arrest effected in New York City by NYPD. The column shows the basic information about the arrest, including the time, location, and level of offense. At the same time, the dataset also contains descriptions of perpetrators, such as gender, age, race, etc. Based on these data, we can well accomplish our research goals. Meanwhile, we will also compare the current year’s arrest information with the past to get the changes in the crime rate in New York City in recent years. We obtain the historic data from the same platform New York OpenData (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u). This dataset has the same format as year-to-date data, making it easy to compare with each other. The historic dataset is last updated on June 9, 2022. We can export these two datasets in CSV format for offline use from New York OpenData. Then we can import and manipulate the CSV formatted data in R from the local path. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources After deciding the topic of the project, all of our team members searched data together to find the most suitable one. We have found that, to identify the crime types, patterns and so on, we need to get some historical crime data. Also, the data released by government or other official department would be more reliable. Here we extract the arrest records data from New York OpenData (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc), which is a free public data source published by New York City agencies and other organizations. The data we will use is collected by the New York Police Department(NYPD), including information about the type of crime, the location, the demographics of perpetrators, and so on. The Office of Management Analysis and Planning extracts and reviews the data every quarter. The data is last updated on Oct 19, 2022. The dataset is categorized as public safety and contains 141,000 observations with 19 columns in a structured form. Each row represents an arrest effected in New York City by NYPD. The column shows the basic information about the arrest, including the time, location, and level of offense. At the same time, the dataset also contains descriptions of perpetrators, such as gender, age, race, etc. Based on these data, we can well accomplish our research goals. To fully explored the arrest pattern, a single dataset is not reliable. Therefore, we collected historic data for arrests records from the same platform, New York OpenData, (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u). This dataset has the same format as year-to-date data, making it easy to compare with each other. However, we found that this historic dataset was only updated on June 9, 2022 lastly, which has been covered by our primal dataset. Therefore, instead of using both datasets, we use only the primal one in our projects. We can export the dataset in CSV format for offline use from New York OpenData. Then we can import and manipulate the CSV formatted data in R from the local path. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation First, we import the Year-to-Date, which is from January 1, 2022, to September 30, 2022, NYPD Arrest Data from NYC OpenData, where each row is an arrest effected in NYC by the NYPD with columns includeing information about the type of crime, the location and time of enforcement, and suspect demographics. Through the glimpse of the dataset, we found that this dataset is well-stored and well-structured. ## Rows: 140,564 ## Columns: 19 ## $ arrest_key &lt;int&gt; 238492853, 238496466, 238498340, 238513835, 23851387… ## $ arrest_date &lt;dttm&gt; 2022-01-01, 2022-01-01, 2022-01-01, 2022-01-01, 202… ## $ pd_cd &lt;int&gt; 258, 244, 792, 109, 112, 339, 114, 101, 105, 665, 77… ## $ pd_desc &lt;chr&gt; &quot;CRIMINAL MISCHIEF 4TH, GRAFFIT&quot;, &quot;BURGLARY,UNCLASSI… ## $ ky_cd &lt;int&gt; 351, 107, 118, 106, 126, 341, 344, 344, 106, 126, 12… ## $ ofns_desc &lt;chr&gt; &quot;CRIMINAL MISCHIEF &amp; RELATED OF&quot;, &quot;BURGLARY&quot;, &quot;DANGE… ## $ law_code &lt;chr&gt; &quot;PL 1456002&quot;, &quot;PL 1402000&quot;, &quot;PL 265031B&quot;, &quot;PL 120050… ## $ law_cat_cd &lt;chr&gt; &quot;M&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F… ## $ arrest_boro &lt;chr&gt; &quot;K&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;M… ## $ arrest_precinct &lt;int&gt; 72, 23, 114, 47, 71, 60, 114, 103, 73, 26, 23, 25, 1… ## $ jurisdiction_code &lt;int&gt; 1, 0, 0, 2, 97, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, … ## $ age_group &lt;chr&gt; &quot;18-24&quot;, &quot;25-44&quot;, &quot;18-24&quot;, &quot;25-44&quot;, &quot;25-44&quot;, &quot;25-44&quot;… ## $ perp_sex &lt;chr&gt; &quot;M&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;M… ## $ perp_race &lt;chr&gt; &quot;WHITE&quot;, &quot;WHITE&quot;, &quot;BLACK&quot;, &quot;BLACK&quot;, &quot;BLACK HISPANIC&quot;… ## $ x_coord_cd &lt;int&gt; 984074, 997744, 1010642, 1026480, 1000099, 985372, 1… ## $ y_coord_cd &lt;int&gt; 178984, 228061, 218253, 262584, 178227, 147958, 2143… ## $ latitude &lt;dbl&gt; 40.65795, 40.79264, 40.76569, 40.88731, 40.65586, 40… ## $ longitude &lt;dbl&gt; -74.00063, -73.95127, -73.90472, -73.84727, -73.9428… ## $ geocoded_column &lt;chr&gt; &quot;POINT (-74.000634 40.657949)&quot;, &quot;POINT (-73.951265 4… ## arrest_key arrest_date pd_cd pd_desc ky_cd ## 1 238492853 2022-01-01 258 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF 4TH, GRAFFIT 351 ## 2 238496466 2022-01-01 244 BURGLARY,UNCLASSIFIED,UNKNOWN 107 ## 3 238498340 2022-01-01 792 CRIMINAL POSSESSION WEAPON 118 ## 4 238513835 2022-01-01 109 ASSAULT 2,1,UNCLASSIFIED 106 ## 5 238513876 2022-01-01 112 MENACING 1ST DEGREE (VICT NOT 126 ## 6 238513883 2022-01-01 339 LARCENY,PETIT FROM OPEN AREAS, 341 ## ofns_desc law_code law_cat_cd arrest_boro ## 1 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF &amp; RELATED OF PL 1456002 M K ## 2 BURGLARY PL 1402000 F M ## 3 DANGEROUS WEAPONS PL 265031B F Q ## 4 FELONY ASSAULT PL 1200501 F B ## 5 MISCELLANEOUS PENAL LAW PL 1201800 F K ## 6 PETIT LARCENY PL 1552500 M K ## arrest_precinct jurisdiction_code age_group perp_sex perp_race ## 1 72 1 18-24 M WHITE ## 2 23 0 25-44 F WHITE ## 3 114 0 18-24 M BLACK ## 4 47 2 25-44 M BLACK ## 5 71 97 25-44 M BLACK HISPANIC ## 6 60 0 25-44 M BLACK ## x_coord_cd y_coord_cd latitude longitude ## 1 984074 178984 40.65795 -74.00063 ## 2 997744 228061 40.79264 -73.95127 ## 3 1010642 218253 40.76569 -73.90472 ## 4 1026480 262584 40.88731 -73.84727 ## 5 1000099 178227 40.65586 -73.94288 ## 6 985372 147958 40.57279 -73.99596 ## geocoded_column ## 1 POINT (-74.000634 40.657949) ## 2 POINT (-73.951265 40.792642) ## 3 POINT (-73.904725 40.765692) ## 4 POINT (-73.8472717577564 40.8873136344706) ## 5 POINT (-73.942878 40.655857) ## 6 POINT (-73.99596126 40.57278637) To transform the dataset into a tidy form for exploratory analysis, we drop the column called ‘geocoded_column’ since this column is a combination of the longitude coordinate as the x coordinate and the latitude coordinate as the y coordinate. ## age_group ## &lt;18 18-24 25-44 45-64 65+ ## 4895 24560 81067 27959 2083 In addition, we notice that the age groups are not classified evenly. Namely, the age groups are ‘&lt;18’, ‘18-24’, ‘25-44’, ‘45-64’, and ‘65+’, where the range of group ‘18-24’ is only 6, while others’ ranges are 19. However, the number of arrests in the age group of ‘18-24’ is extremely large compared to other age groups. It is worth paying attention to and explicitly exploring that remarkable number in plots. Thus, we keep the categories of age unchanged. Therefore, our dataset is in a tidy form to do exploratory data analysis in R now. 3.3 Missing value analysis 3.3.1 Why analyse missing value? In this section, we want to know the distribution of missing values in the original dataset. Through missing pattern analysis, we are able to get an overview of the missing logic and determine how to deal with these missing values. Whether to delete them directly or to approach them based on other non-missing values? 3.3.2 Missing pattern We start by analysis the missing pattern of the whole dataset. The left-bottom bar chart shows the total number of missing values in each column. The right chart shows the intersection pattern of the missing value. From the chart above, we can find that among 19 column in original data set, only 3 columns (pd_cd, pd_desc, ky_cd) has missing value. - pd_cd: Three digit arrest internal classification code. - pd_desc: The description of internal classification code - ky_cd: Three digit internal classification code (more general category than PD code) Notice the relation among pd_cd, pd_desc and ky_cd, it is easy to understand the consistency of missing value. Since the Keycode is a more general category, if the Key code of an arrest event is unknown, the PD code also remains unknown. Similarly, if the PD code is unkown, we cannot describe it. 3.3.3 Missing borough analysis: When faceted on borough, we were surprised to find that majority of missing values are derived from Queens.It is probably due to data filing errors in this region, or the peculiarities of some crimes. We wonder if these arrest belongs to same accident or have some relation. We can propose a hypothesis from the charts above: Arrest data loss occurs throughout the year. There is no peak or obvious pattern, thus missing value is not due to specific incidents or periods, but it is highly likely because of the relatively poor system for arrest categorization in Queens. 3.3.4 Way to deal with the missing value Since we cannot induce the classification of the arrest from known data, and all missing data only account for a small part of the total data (0.27%), we decided to delete these data directly, which will not affect our follow-up data analysis. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Criminals’ portrait 4.2 Crime Types 4.3 Spacial Analysis 4.4 Temporal Analysis", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Criminals’ portrait We start to analyze the crime pattern with plotting the criminals’ portrait. With the arrest records, we plot the basic information namely age, gender and race for all perpetrators by histograms. From the above three figures, we can observe the following characteristics of the captured criminals. First, the number of male perpetrators are highly greater than the number of female perpetrators. Even though the age group, as we mentioned in section 3.2 cleaning and transformation, is not evenly classified, the histogram of the distribution of age among perpetrators shows that the age of perpetrators is mainly concentrated in 25-44 years old. Beside, it is worth to notice that there are a remarkable amount of perpetrators only in their 18-24 years old. In addition, regarding the race distribution of perpetrators, the Black group and White Hispanic group are the two major group of perpetrators. These data and observations are useful to understand the demographics and biometrics of perpetrators, and potentially helpful for NYPD and related researches on crimes in NYC. 4.1.1 Relationship between sex, race and age From the mosaic plot above, we can see the age, gender, and race distribution of arrested people. Overall, males are the vast majority of all arrests. For age, the arrest rate of 25-44 is the highest among all age groups, followed by 18-24 and 45-60. With the weakening of activity, the arrest rate also decreases. For race, black and white Hispanics are the two main arrest groups, and the least arrested races are American Indian and Alaskan natives, which are categorized into “Others”. Also, there is no strong pattern among age, race, and gender. So there is another question: What is the connection between these criminals’ figures and the specific types of crime correspondingly? 4.2 Crime Types First, we calculate the frequency of all crime types as shown in table below. ## Category Frequency Percentage ## 1 ASSAULT 3 &amp; RELATED OFFENSES 23188 16.5409993937 ## 2 PETIT LARCENY 15288 10.9055890431 ## 3 FELONY ASSAULT 14190 10.1223383386 ## 4 MISCELLANEOUS PENAL LAW 9327 6.6533509291 ## 5 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF &amp; RELATED OF 7717 5.5048685665 ## 6 DANGEROUS DRUGS 7686 5.4827549310 ## 7 ROBBERY 7310 5.2145379320 ## 8 GRAND LARCENY 6432 4.5882227057 ## 9 DANGEROUS WEAPONS 6011 4.2879052680 ## 10 BURGLARY 4731 3.3748261226 ## 11 VEHICLE AND TRAFFIC LAWS 4668 3.3298855084 ## 12 OFFENSES AGAINST PUBLIC ADMINI 4203 2.9981809751 ## 13 OFFENSES INVOLVING FRAUD 3627 2.5872953597 ## 14 SEX CRIMES 3192 2.2769911189 ## 15 OFF.

WEAP. ON SCHOOL 1 0.0007133431 We can see that there are 64 types of crimes in total. To have a clear and better understanding of the dataset, we select seven types of crimes which percentage is higher than 5% among the total observations for the further analysis. Then we can have a more explicit and concise plot to present the dataset. Otherwise, there would be a lot of chunks of data which is not very critical or meaningful on the plots. They are [ASSAULT 3 &amp; RELATED OFFENSES, PETIT LARCENY, FELONY ASSAULT, MISCELLANEOUS PENAL LAW, CRIMINAL MISCHIEF &amp; RELATED OF, DANGEROUS DRUGS, ROBBERY]. Here we made an mosaic diagram to show the relationship between the criminals and the crime types. ## NULL Here we can see that the distribution of different crime types is similar in different age groups and sex offenders. No pattern is observed from the mosaic graph. So there is no a strong assocation between the types of crime and the types of offenders. Based on the analysis above, we can infer that there is a certain randomness between the crime rate and crime types. Therefore, the next question would be: are there any factors that are more strongly associated with crime rate in New York? 4.3 Spacial Analysis As we know, neighborhoods in New York are highly different among each other. Specifically, different regions in New York have highly various environments, house pricing, policing environments, different police forces, different people who live there. In this section, we look at the distribution of the number of arrests on map. From the figure above, we can observe that arrests which happened in Manhattan, Bronx and Brooklyn are relatively concentrated.In other words, in general, the crimes are possibly happened in any area in Manhattan, Bronx and Brooklyn. We could not say there is a certain region much safer than others in Manhattan, Bronx and Brooklyn. On Queens and Staten Island, the graphs indicate that there are some places that never have an arrest during the this current year. By the bar plot of the number of arrests based on the borough of NYC, it turns out that the number of arrests occurred in Staten Island is the least consistent with the observation from the map graphs, which is about 1/3 of that in other borough. This bar plot compares the number of various types of arrests based on the different boroughs of NYC. It is worth to notice that the number of Petit Larceny is relatively high in Manhattan compared to other types of crimes in NYC and the number of Petit Larceny in other boroughs. In general, there is no strong pattern between the types of crimes and the boroughs of the crimes, which are evenly distributed with proportions to their total number of crimes in boroughs. 4.4 Temporal Analysis We want to explore if there is any monthly or seasonal pattern over time by plotting the number of arrest over time. If crime is tied to activities, the period at which activities end may impact. This figure shows the number of daily arrests from January 1 2022, to September 30 2022. We can see there is no strong pattern over time. Nevertheless, there is a small increasing during the beginning of 2022 and a slight decreasing around July and August. Paying attention to January 1, 2022, which is the New Year, we can’t conclude that the number of arrests happened on January 1 is higher. The graph shows that the number of crimes is not strongly related to the activities and time. Then we will try to examine if the number of arrests has association with the day of week. We first need to derive the day of week based on the date. Also with subgroups, we can verify if there is a latent factor. By plotting the heatmap of the number of arrests in NYC over time categorized by the day of week, we can notice a pattern that there are more arrests during the weekday than during weekends, specifically on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Moreover, from the graph, we can see that in January and February, overall there are fewer arrests in NYC compared to other months. We also want to examine if certain types of crime may be more time dependent. For example, more traffic violations when people leave work. We can see there is no strong relation among the day of week and the type of crimes, which is consistent with the general pattern. That is there are more arrests during the weekdays in general. For the crime type with the highest frequency, assault and related offenses are not time dependent and there is no certain pattern. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component To exhibit the temporal changes of the number of crime records, we use d3 to plot interactive graphes, click the link to see: [ https://vizhub.com/Jasper129/0a616861f1124b41be3d3ea79f82744c ] In the webpage, there are buttons at the top of the page that list January through September. By clicking the corresponding button, we can see the number of crimes recorded each day of that month, which offers us a easy way to find the seasonal trends or temporal pattern of crime in New York City. With the interactive histogram of the monthly number of arrests over time, there is a weekly pattern each month, which is consistent with the observation from the heatmap among the months, the day of the week, and the number of crimes. When it comes to the limitations of our exploration of arrest records in NYC this year, we only use the interactive histogram plots to show the daily number of arrests each month. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion To explore the arrest records in NYC during 2022, specifically from January 1, 2022 to September 30, 2022, we drew several graphs to understand the pattern of crimes that happened in NYC this current year after slightly cleaning and transforming the data set. Through exploring the demographics and biometric data with histograms, it is remarkable that the number of male perpetrators highly outweighs the number of female perpetrators. The majority of perpetrators are in their 25 to 44 years old. In addition to age and gender, the distribution of race of perpetrators is not uniform as well. The common types of crimes are related to assault and offenses. Through the mosaic plot, surprisingly, there is no strong relationship between the categories of crime and the suspects, and the types of crimes are not gender-specific, race-specific, or age-specific in general. Furthermore, location is a factor in the number of crimes, so it is reasonable to say that some districts are relatively safer than others. Besides, the crimes are not time-dependent. There is no daily or monthly pattern in the number and types of arrests over time. With the interactive histogram of the monthly number of arrests over time, there is a weekly pattern each month, which is consistent with the observation from the heatmap among the months, the day of the week, and the number of crimes. When it comes to the limitations of our exploration of arrest records in NYC this year, we only use the interactive histogram plots to show the daily number of arrests each month. We acknowledge that the interactive map is an efficient way to visualize the location of the crime and help the audience understand the pattern more directly. Besides, this time we focused on the current year’s data, so we didn’t have the opportunity to compare this year’s arrest records and the historical records. The such comparison might help us observe if there is any improvement in terms of public safety and police services over time. Due to the limitation of time and workload during the final week, unfortunately our group didn’t have much time to explore this dataset more deeply and advance our data visualization techniques. One of the most important lessons we learned from this project is that start doing the project early, try to clean and transform the data as tidily as possible, and explore the dataset with multiple plots and techniques. Then we can find a suitable way to visualize and understand the dataset efficiently and effectively. In the future, with a more flexible time span and opportunities to improve the skillsets regarding R and exploratory data analysis, our group will combine the current year’s arrests data with historical data and compare the yearly patterns and changes over time. Moreover, we plan to use more map plots to visualize the relationships among locations, the number of crimes, types of crimes, and so on. Ideally, our group will add more interactive elements in the graphs so that the audience can explore the dataset more freely.
